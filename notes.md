https://www.npmjs.com/package/st-img . just npm install that and put it in your stencil-config. Lazy loads images using https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API

So you can see here, i have installed the `stencil-router` which is a collection of web components that provide routing functionality. https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-stencil-hn-app/blob/master/package.json#L20 . I then just put it here https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-stencil-hn-app/blob/master/stencil.config.js#L10 in my stencil-config, and the compiler handles putting the components in the right place
